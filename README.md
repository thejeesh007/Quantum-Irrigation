# ðŸŒ¾Quantum-Enhanced Smart Irrigation System

This project demonstrates how Variational Quantum Circuits (VQC) can be applied to smart irrigation systems.
The model decides whether to turn the irrigation pump ON or OFF based on environmental features such as Soil Moisture, Temperature, and Humidity.

It compares a Quantum Classifier (VQC) against a Classical Logistic Regression baseline to highlight potential quantum advantages.

ðŸš€ Features

Synthetic dataset generation for irrigation needs

Quantum classifier using Pennylane with variational layers

Classical baseline using Logistic Regression

Model evaluation with Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score

Visualization:

Quantum training cost progression

Confusion matrices (Quantum vs Classical)

# ðŸ“¦ Requirements
